## Installation

Download the “unpacked” folder. Open the Chrome Extensions page (chrome://extensions) and turn developer mode on. Refresh the page and click “load unpacked”. Upload the folder downloaded at the very beginning. Done.

## Usage

Open the tab called “Instagram Saved Downloader” in the Chrome Developer Options (⌘⌥i).

## Features of the app

To grab all the saved posts (single pictures and carousels) and group them into folders by the user.

To select the users or some specific media: when the script grabbed the data (completed status and media thumbnails appeared) click on the preview picture and drag it through — checkboxes under the cursor will change their states according to the status of the checkbox property clicked firstly.

## Possible to add

Downloading videos, grouping of carousels and meaningful filenames could be provided.

## Disclaimer

I’m a beginner and the code may be not that good. I hope it’s working at least. If it’s not — I’m sorry and you’re welcome to open an issue.
